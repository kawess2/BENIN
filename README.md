#BENIN
This repository stores the source code for BENIN: Biologically Enhanced Network INference
BENIN infers the gene regulatory network by combining time series gene expression data with prior knowledge data such as genome wide location data (ChiP-chip), transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), perturbation data or ortholog regulatory information from closely related model organisms

The BENIN source code is in the R folder

BENIN has been applied to:
1)  Whitfield Human Hela data (http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Human-CellCycle/Hela/data.shtml). The source code for applying BENIN to human Hela data is accessible in: realdatanetworkinference/humanhelanetwork
2) DREAM4 challenge data (http://dreamchallenges.org/project/dream4-in-silico-network-challenge/). The source code of applying BENIN to the DREAM4 challenge data is accessible on dreamfourcode/ folder
